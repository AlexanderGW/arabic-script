# Arabic script learning
This is just a tool to help me learn & read Arabic script, specifically the different forms that each character can take.

It's also using an English phonetic hint, that I find easy; not necessily useful for others.

## Support
- Currently: Rasm; with sans/serif toggle.
- Future: Diacritics; I intend to expand upon this, such as introducing toggles for consonant/vowel diacritics.

## Install & run
Requires PNPM, Node 20.x; uses Vite

`pnpm i && pnpm run dev`

Then visit `http://localhost:5173/`

## Disclaimer
This project has been thrown together as a linguistic hobby, it is likely to have errors!
